# Neural Style Transfer

Code to experiment with the Neural Style Transfer techniques and generate some cool pictures in the process.
You can play with `neural_style_transfer_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab or run the code locally via `python neural_style_transfer.py`.

The same concept can be used to generate adversarial examples but this functionality is not currently included in the repo.
I will try to add it at some point if I have free time.
